### Description

Welcome onboard fellow developer/ designer, this is where you will upload your additions to our website.
This is a collaborations of awesome minds building a primary school website and student results management system.

This web application will allow the parents of Towering Heights School to view the results of their children from the comfort of their own homes. 
They will be able to download or print these results at their own leisure. 
The main website will be a place to go to stay updated on the latest news and will be used as a way to woo prospective parents and pupils.

We'll be making use of NextJS, TypeScript, and Chakra-UI for the frontend development; Django for Backend development; Figma for UI/UX Designs; Github, Notion and Slack for collaboration and communication.\
a. [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a React Framework for production. Reasons for NextJS include great user experience, great for SEO, great performance, flexibility with UI/UX builds, and many development advantages.\
b. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language developed as a superset of JavaScript that helps manage large-scale JS projects. Reasons for TypeScript include static typing, readability, compilation, and auto-completion while coding.\
c. [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is a CSS library that provides accessible and reusable components for React Apps. Reasons for Chakra-UI include easily customizable, theme mode, and responsive styles(Media queries).\
d. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is an open source web framework built on top of python. Reason for Django is the Django is the super fast development of backend applications.\
d. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a design and prototyping tool used to design websites, and applications. Reasons include speed and ease to use, promoting teamwork among designers, slack integration, and bringing everyone on the team in the process.\
e. [Github](http://github.com/) is an Internet hosting provider for software development and version control using Git. Reasons include slack integration, an online repository that allows collaborators, and keeps track of code, and documentation.\
f. [Slack](https://www.slack.com/) is a communication tool. Reasons include easy communication, allowing integration of other apps, and sharing files.\
g. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a documentation tool. Reasons include easy communication and allowing easy identification of tasks.\
h. [Python](https://www.python.com) is a general purpose programming language. Reasons for Python include readability, ease of syntax, and compilation.\

I believe one main challenge at first, will be working together as a big team. This is a new exciting project for lots of us, so ideas and unfamiliar technology will be flinging left, right and centre.
However, after a while we should be functioning like a well oiled machine. For myself, this as well as the ever present battle between Devs and bugs will be a little challenging.
In regard to the feature I would like to implement, being a python developer, I would love to use the Django framework for the Backend, having dabbled a little in Flask.
